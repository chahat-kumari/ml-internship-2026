I want to learn Machine Learning because it’s the shift from telling computers what to do to teaching them how to think through data. In the real world, I plan to turn this into a business by building custom automation tools such as predictive sales models or intelligent chatbots—that help companies reduce costs and unlock revenue they’re currently leaving on the table.
